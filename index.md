## About Me

<img src="BarryLinkedIn.jpg" alt="Barry Moore headshot" width="150" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-radius: 8px;" />


I’m a senior scientist in genomics and bioinformatics, applying over two decades of experience to advance Fabric Genomics’ AI-powered genome interpretation platform. My focus is on building and refining clinical-grade workflows for rare disease diagnostics — combining technical craft with deep domain knowledge to deliver scalable solutions that boost diagnostic yield and get answers to patients faster.

Before joining Fabric Genomics full-time, I spent more than 25 years at the University of Utah at the intersection of biology, computation, and clinical translation. My work spanned the full arc of genomic research and diagnostics — from early bench science in translational recoding, to developing widely used tools like MAKER, VAAST, and VVP, to shaping workflows for major projects such as Heritage 1K, NeoSeq, and GeneKids. Along the way, I contributed to disease gene discovery efforts across a spectrum of rare Mendelian and common complex diseases, using approaches that ranged from cohort-scale genome analysis to detailed single-case studies.

I’ve worked with Fabric Genomics for over a decade, leading analysis on high-impact research collaborations and helping refine variant and disease-gene prioritization strategies in GEM, Fabric’s AI-driven genome interpretation engine. Throughout my career, I’ve earned a reputation for cross-disciplinary fluency — bridging engineering, biology, and clinical care — and for delivering solutions that work when it matters most.

I’m deeply curious about what’s next in genomics, AI, and technology, and how advances in these fields can be transformed into tools that make a difference for patients, clinicians, and researchers alike.
