## About Me

<img src="BarryLinkedIn.jpg" alt="Barry Moore headshot" width="150" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-radius: 8px;" />

I am currently Senior Scientist, Precision Genomics at Fabric Genomics, where I develop clinical-grade workflows for rare disease diagnostics. I apply over two decades of genomics and bioinformatics experience to advance our AI-powered genome interpretation platform — combining technical craft with deep domain expertise to deliver scalable solutions that boost diagnostic yield and get answers to patients faster.

Before joining Fabric full-time, I spent more than 25 years at the University of Utah at the intersection of biology, computation, and clinical translation. My work spanned the full arc of genomic research and diagnostics — from early bench science in translational recoding, to developing widely used tools like MAKER, VAAST, and VVP, to shaping workflows for major projects such as Heritage 1K, NeoSeq, and GeneKids. Along the way, I contributed to disease gene discovery efforts across a spectrum of rare Mendelian and common complex diseases, using approaches that ranged from cohort-scale genome analysis to detailed single-case studies.

As a long-time consultant with Fabric, I led analysis on high-impact research collaborations and refined variant and disease-gene prioritization strategies in GEM, our AI-driven genome interpretation engine. Throughout my career, I’ve built a reputation for cross-disciplinary fluency — communicating and contributing across engineering, biology, and clinical care domains — and for delivering solutions that work when it matters most.

I remain deeply curious about what’s next in genomics, AI, and technology, and how advances in these fields can be transformed into tools that make a meaningful difference for patients, clinicians, and researchers alike.
